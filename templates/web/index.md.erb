### How To Import

In your Gemfile add:

~~~ruby
gem "<%= Origen.app.name %>", ">= <%= Origen.app.version %>"
~~~

or if your application is a gem add this to your <code>.gemspec</code>

~~~ruby
spec.add_runtime_dependency "<%= Origen.app.name %>", ">= <%= Origen.app.version %>"
~~~

### How To Use

Tester programs and patterns can easily be generated for different testers simply by changing the above instantiation.
